# Heros of Pymoli

## Background

In this project, I was tasked with generating a report that breaks down a free (fictional) mobile game's optional purchasing data, [in CSV format](https://nu.bootcampcontent.com/NU-Coding-Bootcamp/nu-chi-data-pt-11-2020-u-c/blob/master/Homework/04-Pandas/Instructions/HeroesOfPymoli/Resources/purchase_data.csv), into meaningful insights.

## The Report Incudes the Following:

### Player Count

## Observations

1. The company's revenue driving demographic is males, ages 20-24
    
2. The majority of gamers appear to only make small, one-time purchases, although the range of time in which this data was collected is   unclear.
    
3. The majority of revenue is generated by a handful of popular items, such as, 'Final Critic' and 'Oathbreaker,' 'Last Hope of Breaking the Storm'
